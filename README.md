üßê About
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This is a project that is built with the aim to learn and apply concepts of high level programming and software engineering in general.

üèÅ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python3

Installing
Clone this reposito

git clone git@github.com:pelumiolawole/AirBnB_clone.git
cd AirBnB_clone
./console.py
üîß Running the tests
This project uses the python unittest model for automated tests

Run all unit tests
python3 -m unittest discover tests

Run a test from a specific file
python3 -m unittest tests/tespytestt_models/test_base_model.py

üéà Usage
You can run the schell (in an interactive or non-interactive mode) to manipulate your models. You can start it from running the console.py file:

$ ./console.py
The following commands are supported:

create:
Creates a new instance of BaseModel, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id. Ex:

$ create BaseModel
show:
Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id. Ex:

$ show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.
destroy:
Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). Ex:

$ destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.
all:
Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. Example to show all instances

$ all
Example to show all instances of BaseModel only

$ all BaseModel
update:
Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). Ex:

$ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "airbnb@alxholbertonschool.com"
quit:
